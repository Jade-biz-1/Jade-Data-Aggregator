# Story: Implement Basic Data Collection Module

## Status
Draft

## Story
As a data aggregator system user, I want to be able to connect to various data sources so that I can collect data from multiple endpoints.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The system can connect to REST API endpoints
- The system can authenticate with API keys
- The system can handle basic data formats (JSON, CSV)
- The system logs connection attempts and errors

## Tasks
- [ ] Create data source connector interface
- [ ] Implement REST API connector
- [ ] Implement API key authentication
- [ ] Add support for JSON and CSV formats
- [ ] Implement connection logging

## Dev Notes
Consider using standard HTTP client libraries and implementing connection pooling for efficiency.

## Testing
- Unit tests for each connector type
- Integration test with sample API endpoint
- Test authentication failure scenarios
