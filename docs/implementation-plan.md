### Sprint 3-4: Core Data Pipeline Framework
- [x] Implement pipeline management service with CRUD operations
- [x] Create pipeline execution tracking system
- [x] Implement scheduling framework using cron-based jobs
- [x] Build pipeline dependency management
- [x] Create pipeline status monitoring
- [x] Implement connector service with plugin architecture
- [x] Create REST API connector with authentication
- [x] Implement connection pooling
- [x] Build metadata extraction for data sources
- [x] Create connector configuration UI in frontend

## Current State

The foundational components of the Data Aggregator Platform have been successfully implemented:

1. **Backend**: Complete with authentication, user management, pipeline management, and connector services
2. **Frontend**: Basic UI with authentication, dashboard, and responsive layout
3. **Infrastructure**: Docker containerization, Terraform IaC, CI/CD pipeline, and monitoring
4. **Documentation**: Comprehensive README with setup and deployment instructions

## Next Steps

Based on the implementation plan, the next steps include:

- Handle rate limiting and error responses
- Support for pagination and incremental sync
- Implement schema validation against rules
- Create data quality checks
- Build basic anomaly detection
- Implement data profiling capabilities
- Create validation UI for monitoring
- Implement data storage service with multi-destination support
- Implement data partitioning strategies
- Build index optimization for data storage
- Implement backup and recovery mechanisms
- Implement data versioning functionality
- Create data retention policies with automated archival
- Implement data lineage tracking
- Create metadata repository for schema and configuration
- Implement monitoring database for metrics and logs

### Sprint 7-8: UI & MVP Integration

## Technologies Used

### Backend
- Python 3.10+
- FastAPI for web framework
- SQLAlchemy for ORM
- PostgreSQL for database
- Redis for caching
- Kafka for message queuing
- Celery for task queue
- Pydantic for data validation

### Frontend
- Next.js 14+
- React 18+
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- TypeScript for type safety
- Zustand for state management

### Infrastructure
- Docker for containerization
- Terraform for IaC
- AWS (ECS, ECR, RDS, ElastiCache, MSK)
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Prometheus/Grafana for monitoring

## Quality Assurance

- Unit tests with Pytest
- Type checking with mypy
- Linting with flake8
- Security scanning with bandit
- Frontend linting and type checking

## Deployment

The application can be deployed in multiple ways:
1. Containerized deployment with Docker Compose for development
2. AWS ECS with Fargate for production using Terraform
3. Kubernetes with Helm charts (planned)
4. Direct cloud deployment (AWS/Azure/GCP)

## Security

- OAuth 2.0 with JWT tokens
- Role-based access control
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) protection
- Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection
- Security headers
