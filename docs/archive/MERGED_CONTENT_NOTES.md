# Merged Content Notes

**Date:** October 7, 2025
**Action:** Frontend documentation files merged into IMPLEMENTATION_TASKS.md

**Update (Nov 2025):** Detailed task breakdowns now live in `TasksTracking/phase-07-frontend-completion-production-hardening.md`

## Files Archived/Deleted

### Archived

- `implementation-plan-historical.md` - Historical MVP implementation record (Sprints 1-4)

### Content Merged from (then deleted)

1. **frontend-implementation-tasks.md**
   - Detailed task breakdowns (Task 1.1, 1.2, etc.)
   - File path specifications
   - Testing requirements per task
   - Effort estimates and complexity ratings
   - Priority system (P1.1-P5.2)

2. **frontend-advanced-features-implementation-plan.md**
   - PRD requirement mappings (FR-4.1, FR-5.1, FR-5.2, NFR-6.1)
   - Current state assessment
   - Success metrics (technical + UX)
   - Risk assessment with mitigation strategies
   - Backend API enhancement requirements
   - Library dependencies list

## Merged Into

- **IMPLEMENTATION_TASKS.md** - Phase 7 sections enhanced with:
  - Detailed subtask breakdowns
  - Specific file paths for implementation
  - Testing requirements
  - PRD traceability
  - Risk mitigation strategies
- **TasksTracking/phase-07-frontend-completion-production-hardening.md** - Canonical home for these Phase 7 details after November 2025 roadmap re-organization

## Rationale

- Single source of truth for implementation roadmap
- Eliminated redundancy across 3 documents
- Preserved valuable detailed planning information
- Maintained historical record in archive

## Next Steps

- All future implementation planning updates go to the roadmap index (`IMPLEMENTATION_TASKS.md`) and corresponding `TasksTracking/phase-*.md` files
- Archive directory preserved for historical reference
