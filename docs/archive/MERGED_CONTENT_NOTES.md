**Date:** October 7, 2025
**Action:** Frontend documentation files merged into IMPLEMENTATION_TASKS.md

## Files Archived/Deleted

### Archived:
- `implementation-plan-historical.md` - Historical MVP implementation record (Sprints 1-4)

### Content Merged from (then deleted):
1. **frontend-implementation-tasks.md**
   - Detailed task breakdowns (Task 1.1, 1.2, etc.)
   - File path specifications

   - Current state assessment
   - Success metrics (technical + UX)
   - Risk assessment with mitigation strategies

## Merged Into:
- **IMPLEMENTATION_TASKS.md** - Phase 7 sections enhanced with:
  - Detailed subtask breakdowns
  - Specific file paths for implementation
  - Testing requirements

## Rationale:
- Single source of truth for implementation roadmap
- Eliminated redundancy across 3 documents

- Archive directory preserved for historical reference
