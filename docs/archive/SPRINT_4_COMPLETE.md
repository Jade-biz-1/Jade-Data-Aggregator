## 📦 Technical Implementation

### Consistent Pattern Applied Across All Pages

**1. Error Handling:**
```typescript
try {
  setLoading(true);
  const data = await api.getData();
  setData(data);
  success('Operation completed successfully', 'Success');
} catch (err: any) {
  console.error('Error:', err);
  error(err.message || 'Failed to complete operation', 'Error');
  // Set fallback data
} finally {
  setLoading(false);
}
```

**2. Permission Checks:**
```typescript
// Loading state
if (permissionsLoading || isLoading) {
  return <LoadingSpinner />;
}

// Permission check
if (!features?.feature?.permission) {
  return <AccessDenied message="..." />;
}
```

**3. Toast Notifications:**
```typescript
const { toasts, error, success, warning } = useToast();

// In JSX
<ToastContainer toasts={toasts} />

// Usage
success('Action completed', 'Success');
error('Action failed', 'Error');
warning('Please check this', 'Warning');
```
