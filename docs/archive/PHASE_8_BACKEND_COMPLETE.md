## üìã Permission System

### 6 Roles Implemented

1. **Admin** - Full system access (40+ permissions)
2. **Developer** - Near-admin access, cannot modify admin user (38 permissions)
3. **Designer** - Pipeline/connector/transformation management (18 permissions)
4. **Executor** - Execute pipelines, view monitoring (9 permissions)
5. **Viewer** - Read-only dashboard access (4 permissions)
6. **Executive** - Analytics and reports access (7 permissions)

### 40+ Granular Permissions

**Categories:**
- User Management (7 permissions)
- Pipeline Management (5 permissions)
- Connector Management (5 permissions)
- Transformation Management (4 permissions)
- Dashboard & Monitoring (5 permissions)
- Analytics & Reports (3 permissions)
- System Management (4 permissions)
- File Management (3 permissions)

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Changes

### New Table: system_settings

```sql
CREATE TABLE system_settings (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    key VARCHAR NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    value TEXT,
    value_type VARCHAR DEFAULT 'string',
    description TEXT,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    expires_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
);
```

**Indexes:**
- `idx_system_settings_key` - Fast key lookups
- `idx_system_settings_active` - Filter active settings

---

## üîß Environment Variables

Add to your `.env` file:

```bash
# Phase 8: Enhanced RBAC
CREATE_DEV_USER=false              # Set to 'true' to create developer user
ENVIRONMENT=development             # development | staging | production
AUTO_INIT_DB=true                  # Auto-initialize database (false in production)
```

---

## üì¶ How to Deploy

### Step 1: Run Database Migration

```bash
# Connect to your database
psql "postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/dbname" < migrations/001_add_system_settings.sql
```

### Step 2: Update Environment Variables

Add the variables above to your `.env` file.

### Step 3: Restart Application

```bash
# If using Docker
docker compose down
docker compose up -d

# If using direct Python
# Kill existing process and restart
python -m backend.main
```

### Step 4: Verify Installation

```bash
# Check if new endpoints are available
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/roles

# Check system settings endpoint
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/admin/settings/dev-role-production \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN"
```

## üß™ Testing Checklist

Before marking as complete, test these scenarios:

### Role-Based Access
- [ ] Admin can access all endpoints
- [ ] Developer cannot modify admin user
- [ ] Designer can manage pipelines
- [ ] Executor can run pipelines
- [ ] Viewer has read-only access
- [ ] Executive can view analytics

### Admin Protection
- [ ] Cannot delete admin user
- [ ] Cannot deactivate admin user
- [ ] Cannot reset admin password
- [ ] Developer role blocked from admin modifications

### Production Safeguards
- [ ] Developer role blocked in production
- [ ] Admin can enable developer role temporarily
- [ ] Developer role auto-expires after 24 hours
- [ ] Warning banner appears when developer role active

### Cleanup Operations
- [ ] Activity logs cleanup works
- [ ] Orphaned data cleanup works
- [ ] Temp files cleanup works
- [ ] Database vacuum completes
- [ ] Statistics endpoint returns data
- [ ] Estimate endpoint calculates correctly

### Database Protection
- [ ] AUTO_INIT_DB=false prevents init
- [ ] Backup created before initialization
- [ ] Production blocks automatic init with data
- [ ] Backup/restore utilities work

## üìù Next Steps

### Immediate (Required for Production)
1. **Run Database Migration** - Apply system_settings table
2. **Update Environment Variables** - Configure for your environment
3. **Test All Endpoints** - Verify everything works
4. **Review Security Settings** - Ensure production safeguards active

### Short Term (1-2 weeks)
1. **Frontend Implementation** (F035-F041) - ~28 hours
2. **Integration Testing** - ~12 hours
3. **Documentation Updates** - ~6 hours

### Long Term (Optional Enhancements)
1. **Automated Cleanup Scheduling** - Implement Celery/APScheduler
2. **Cleanup History Tracking** - Store cleanup results in database
3. **Advanced Analytics** - Role usage statistics
4. **Audit Trail** - Enhanced activity logging

## üéì Key Learnings & Best Practices

### What Worked Well
- Comprehensive permission system allows fine-grained control
- Admin protection prevents accidental lockout
- Production safeguards ensure security
- Cleanup services improve system maintainability

### Design Decisions
- **6 Roles vs 3 Roles:** Provides better separation of concerns
- **Developer Role:** Useful for testing without admin privileges
- **Auto-expiring Settings:** Security-first approach
- **Comprehensive Cleanup:** Single endpoint to clean everything

### Production Recommendations
- Always run migrations during maintenance window
- Test in staging environment first
- Keep developer role disabled in production
- Schedule cleanup operations during off-peak hours
- Monitor cleanup operation impact
