- Document creation and management
- Story drafting and validation
- Architecture planning
- Quality assessment
- Risk analysis

## Quick Usage Examples

For most IDEs that support manual rules (like Cursor or Windsurf):

`@pm Create a PRD for a task management app`
`@architect Design the system architecture`
`@dev Implement the user authentication`

For IDEs that use slash commands (like Claude Code):

`/pm Create user stories`
`/dev Fix the login bug`
`/qa Review the security implementation`

## Best Practices

1. Always start conversations in a new chat context when switching agents
2. Use the appropriate agent for the task at hand
3. Follow the structured workflow suggested by the method
4. Keep context files lean and focused
5. Commit regularly to track progress
6. Validate documents against requirements
