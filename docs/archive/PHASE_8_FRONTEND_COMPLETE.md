## 🎓 LESSONS LEARNED

1. **Reusable Components:** Creating SystemStats, CleanupResults, and CleanupScheduler as separate components makes them reusable and testable.

2. **Permission Pattern:** The pattern of checking `features?.resource?.action` is consistent and easy to understand.

3. **Loading States:** Always show loading states during permission checks to avoid flashing content.

4. **Confirmation Dialogs:** Critical operations like cleanup require confirmation dialogs.

5. **Export Functionality:** Providing export of results helps with auditing and troubleshooting.
