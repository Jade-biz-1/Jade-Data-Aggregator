2. **Team Management**: Group users into teams with shared resources
3. **Resource Quotas**: Limit pipeline executions per role
4. **Advanced Audit**: Real-time audit log streaming, SIEM integration
5. **Cleanup Policies**: More granular retention policies per resource type
6. **Automated Archival**: Archive old data to S3/cloud storage instead of deletion
7. **Multi-Tenancy**: Isolate data between organizations

## Conclusion

Phase 8 transforms the Data Aggregator Platform into an enterprise-grade system with:
- **Granular access control** suitable for large organizations
- **Self-service maintenance** reducing operational burden
- **Production safeguards** preventing accidental data loss
- **Long-term sustainability** through automated cleanup

This phase positions the platform for production deployment in enterprises with multiple user types, strict access controls, and long-term operational requirements.
