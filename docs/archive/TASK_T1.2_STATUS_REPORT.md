**Note:** Most services don't have dedicated CRUD operations - they're specialized services.

---

## 🎯 Revised Task T1.2 Plan

### Option 1: Complete Original T1.2 (18 more tests)

Create tests for CRUD-like operations that exist:

1. **test_pipeline_executor_service.py** (~10 tests)
   - Test pipeline execution flow
   - Test execution state management
   - Test error handling during execution
   - Mock database operations

2. **test_service_crud_operations.py** (~8 tests)
   - Test any CRUD service operations
   - Test permission checks
   - Test validation logic
   - Test error scenarios

**Result:** T1.2 100% complete (53 tests total)

---

### Option 2: Acknowledge Existing Work & Move On

**Current State:**
- ✅ 35 service tests already exist (66% of target)
- ✅ High-quality, comprehensive tests
- ✅ Cover critical validation and transformation logic

**Rationale:**
- The existing tests cover the most complex service logic
- Remaining services are either:
  - Simple CRUD wrappers (tested via integration tests)
  - Specialized services (need specific test strategies)
  - Already covered by model tests

**Recommendation:** Mark T1.2 as substantially complete, move to T1.3

---

### Option 3: Test Additional Critical Services (Recommended)

Focus on the most important untested services:

1. **test_pipeline_execution_engine.py** (~10 tests)
   - Execution state tracking
   - Step-by-step execution
   - Rollback functionality
   - Error handling
   - Logging

2. **test_auth_service.py** (~8 tests)
   - User authentication
   - Token generation/validation
   - Permission checks
   - Password reset

**Result:** 53 tests total, critical services covered

---

## 💡 Recommendation

### **Option 3: Test Pipeline Execution Engine + Auth Service**

**Why?**
1. Pipeline execution engine is critical (9.5 KB of complex logic)
2. Auth service is critical for security
3. Achieves 53+ test target
4. Tests most important business logic
5. Natural progression before integration tests

**Next Steps:**
1. Create `test_pipeline_execution_engine.py` (~10 tests)
2. Create `test_auth_service.py` (~8 tests)
3. Mark Task T1.2 as COMPLETE (53 tests total)
4. Move to Task T1.3: Integration Tests

---

## 🎉 Positive Finding

The fact that 35 service tests already exist is **excellent news**!

**This means:**
- ✅ Previous work was more complete than expected
- ✅ Most complex service logic already tested
- ✅ We're ahead of schedule
- ✅ Can focus on remaining critical services or move to integration tests

---

**Recommendation:** Option A - Complete T1.2 by testing 2 more critical services (execution engine + auth)

**Next:** Await your decision on how to proceed!
