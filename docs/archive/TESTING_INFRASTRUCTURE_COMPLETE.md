## 🚀 How to Use the Testing Infrastructure

### Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Check prerequisites
./testing/scripts/check-prerequisites.sh

# 2. Set up test environment
./testing/scripts/setup-test-env.sh

# 3. Run all tests (when tests are written)
./testing/scripts/run-tests.sh

# 4. Clean up
./testing/scripts/teardown-test-env.sh
```

### Running Specific Test Stages

```bash
# Run only backend unit tests
./testing/scripts/run-tests.sh --stage backend_unit

# Run without fail-fast (continue on failures)
./testing/scripts/run-tests.sh --no-fail-fast

# Capture all artifacts
./testing/scripts/run-tests.sh --capture-all
```

### Manual Docker Commands

```bash
# Start test environment
docker compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up -d

# View logs
docker compose -f docker-compose.test.yml logs -f test-db

# Connect to test database
docker exec -it dataaggregator-test-db psql -U test_user -d dataaggregator_test

# Stop test environment
docker compose -f docker-compose.test.yml down -v
```

## 🎓 What You Learned

By completing Week 0, we've established:

1. **Test Isolation** - How to isolate test environment from development
2. **Docker Compose Testing** - Multi-service test environments
3. **Test Automation** - Automated setup, execution, and teardown
4. **Test Organization** - Structured directory layout for maintainability
5. **Configuration Management** - Environment-specific configurations
6. **Health Checks** - Ensuring services are ready before tests run
7. **Test Data Management** - Seeding reproducible test data

---

## 🚧 Known Limitations

1. **Poetry Not Required**: Docker Compose v2 (`docker compose`) is available, not the standalone `docker-compose`
2. **Tests Not Written Yet**: Infrastructure is ready, but actual tests need to be written (Weeks 1-12)
3. **CI/CD Not Integrated Yet**: GitHub Actions workflow needs to be updated (Week 4, T4.2)
4. **Performance Tests**: Infrastructure ready, but performance tests not implemented (Weeks 9-10)
5. **Security Tests**: Infrastructure ready, but security tests not implemented (Week 11)

None of these limitations block progress on Week 1 tasks!

## 📞 Support & Next Steps

### If You Need Help

1. Read `testing/README.md` first
2. Check prerequisites with `./testing/scripts/check-prerequisites.sh`
3. Review logs in `testing/reports/logs/`
4. Check Docker containers: `docker ps` and `docker logs`

### To Get Started with Week 1

```bash
# 1. Set up test environment
./testing/scripts/setup-test-env.sh

# 2. Start writing backend model tests
cd backend
mkdir -p tests/unit/models
code tests/unit/models/test_user_model.py

# 3. Run tests as you write them
poetry run pytest tests/unit/models/test_user_model.py -v
```
