## 5. Core Application Features

### 5.1 Pipelines

Pipelines are the core functionality of the Data Aggregator Platform, allowing you to define, schedule, and execute data workflows. A pipeline connects data sources to destinations through a series of transformations and processing steps, providing a complete data integration solution.

#### 5.1.1 Pipeline Definition

- **Source Configuration**: Define data source connections using connectors
- **Destination Configuration**: Specify where processed data should be stored
- **Transformation Rules**: Apply transformations to convert data to desired format
- **Schedule Settings**: Configure when and how often the pipeline should run
- **Error Handling**: Define retry logic and error notification settings
- **Data Validation**: Set up quality checks and validation rules
- **Data Lineage**: Track the origin and transformations of data as it flows through the pipeline
- **Monitoring & Alerts**: Configure notifications for pipeline status changes
- **Performance Metrics**: Track throughput, processing times, and resource utilization
- **Dependency Management**: Define relationships between multiple pipelines

#### 5.1.2 Creating Pipelines

A pipeline defines how data moves from source to destination with optional transformations. Here's how to create one:

1. Navigate to the "Pipelines" section in the UI
2. Click "Create Pipeline"
3. Configure source and destination connectors
4. Define transformation rules (optional)
5. Set scheduling options (cron expressions or event triggers)
6. Configure error handling and notification settings
7. Save and deploy the pipeline

**Detailed Example: E-commerce Data Pipeline**

Let's create a pipeline that aggregates sales data from multiple sources:

**Step 1: Define the source** - A REST API from an e-commerce platform
```json
{
  "source": {
    "connector_type": "REST API",
    "config": {
      "url": "https://api.ecommerce-platform.com/v1/orders",
      "auth_method": "API_KEY",
      "auth_params": {
        "api_key_header": "X-API-Key",
        "api_key_value": "your-api-key-here"
      },
      "pagination": {
        "type": "offset",
        "page_size": 100
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Sample source data:**
```json
[
  {
    "order_id": "ORD-001",
    "customer_id": "CUST-123",
    "product_name": "wireless mouse",
    "quantity": 2,
    "price": 29.99,
    "order_date": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
    "status": "completed",
    "customer_email": "john.doe@example.com"
  },
  {
    "order_id": "ORD-002",
    "customer_id": "CUST-456",
    "product_name": "mechanical keyboard",
    "quantity": 1,
    "price": 89.99,
    "order_date": "2025-01-15T11:45:00Z",
    "status": "pending",
    "customer_email": "jane.smith@example.com"
  },
  {
    "order_id": "ORD-003",
    "customer_id": "CUST-123",
    "product_name": "usb cable",
    "quantity": 3,
    "price": 9.99,
    "order_date": "2025-01-15T14:20:00Z",
    "status": "completed",
    "customer_email": "john.doe@example.com"
  }
]
```

**Step 2: Apply transformations** - Clean and standardize the data
- Convert all product names to title case
- Calculate total price (quantity √ó price)
- Filter out orders with status other than "completed"
- Add a "processed_timestamp" field
- Validate email format

**Transformation Rules Example:**
```json
{
  "transformations": [
    {
      "type": "field_mapping",
      "field_name": "product_name",
      "operation": "title_case"
    },
    {
      "type": "field_calculation",
      "field_name": "total_price",
      "operation": "multiply",
      "parameters": {
        "source_fields": ["quantity", "price"],
        "output_field": "total_price"
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "record_filter",
      "condition": {
        "field": "status",
        "operator": "equals",
        "value": "completed"
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "field_addition",
      "field_name": "processed_timestamp",
      "value": "current_timestamp"
    },
    {
      "type": "field_validation",
      "field_name": "customer_email",
      "validation_type": "email_format"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Step 3: Define the destination** - Store in a data warehouse (e.g., Snowflake)
```json
{
  "destination": {
    "connector_type": "Snowflake",
    "config": {
      "host": "your-account.snowflakecomputing.com",
      "database": "SALES_DB",
      "schema": "PROCESSED",
      "table": "daily_orders",
      "warehouse": "COMPUTE_WH"
    }
  }
}
```

**Final transformed data:**
```json
[
  {
    "order_id": "ORD-001",
    "customer_id": "CUST-123",
    "product_name": "Wireless Mouse",
    "quantity": 2,
    "unit_price": 29.99,
    "total_price": 59.98,
    "order_date": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
    "status": "completed",
    "customer_email": "john.doe@example.com",
    "processed_timestamp": "2025-01-16T08:00:00Z"
  },
  {
    "order_id": "ORD-003",
    "customer_id": "CUST-123",
    "product_name": "Usb Cable",
    "quantity": 3,
    "unit_price": 9.99,
    "total_price": 29.97,
    "order_date": "2025-01-15T14:20:00Z",
    "status": "completed",
    "customer_email": "john.doe@example.com",
    "processed_timestamp": "2025-01-16T08:00:00Z"
  }
]
```

**Step 4: Schedule the pipeline** - Run it daily at 8:00 AM UTC
```json
{
  "schedule": {
    "type": "cron",
    "expression": "0 8 * * *",
    "timezone": "UTC"
  }
}
```

**Step 5: Set up error handling** - Retry failed records up to 3 times with exponential backoff
```json
{
  "error_handling": {
    "retry_policy": {
      "max_retries": 3,
      "backoff_multiplier": 2,
      "initial_delay_seconds": 1
    },
    "notifications": {
      "email": ["admin@example.com"],
      "webhook": "https://hooks.example.com/pipeline-alerts"
    }
  }
}
```

**Advanced Example: Renewable Energy Wind Turbine Monitoring Pipeline**

This example demonstrates a high-frequency, real-time pipeline for wind farm operations:

**Step 1: Define multiple real-time sources**
```json
{
  "sources": [
    {
      "name": "turbine_scada",
      "connector_type": "OPC_UA",
      "config": {
        "endpoint": "opc.tcp://windfarm-01.example.com:4840",
        "security_mode": "SignAndEncrypt",
        "nodes": [
          "ns=2;s=Turbine.PowerOutput",
          "ns=2;s=Turbine.RotorSpeed",
          "ns=2;s=Turbine.WindSpeed",
          "ns=2;s=Turbine.GearboxTemp"
        ],
        "sampling_interval": 1000
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "weather_api",
      "connector_type": "REST_API",
      "config": {
        "url": "https://api.weather.com/v1/forecasts",
        "refresh_interval": 900000
