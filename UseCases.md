## 1. E-commerce Data Integration

### Scenario
An e-commerce company wants to consolidate sales data from multiple platforms (Shopify, WooCommerce, Magento) into a central data warehouse for analytics.

### Current Challenge: 
- Sales data scattered across multiple e-commerce platforms
- Different data formats and structures
- Manual export and import processes are time-consuming and error-prone
- Incomplete picture of customer behavior across platforms

### Solution with Data Aggregator Platform:

**Step 1: Create Connectors for Each Platform**
- Shopify: REST API connector with OAuth authentication
- WooCommerce: REST API connector with API key authentication
- Magento: REST API connector with token-based authentication
- Data Warehouse: Snowflake connector for the central data warehouse

**Sample Source Data from Shopify:**
```json
[
  {
    "id": 123456789,
    "email": "customer@example.com",
    "created_at": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
    "total_price": "29.99",
    "currency": "USD",
    "line_items": [
      {
        "name": "Wireless Headphones",
        "quantity": 1,
        "price": "29.99"
      }
    ],
    "customer": {
      "id": 987654321,
      "first_name": "John",
      "last_name": "Doe",
      "email": "customer@example.com",
      "orders_count": 5
    }
  }
]
```

**Sample Source Data from WooCommerce:**
```json
[
  {
    "id": 987,
    "status": "completed",
    "customer_id": 456,
    "date_created": "2025-01-15T11:45:00Z",
    "total": "19.99",
    "currency": "USD",
    "billing": {
      "first_name": "Jane",
      "last_name": "Smith",
      "email": "jane@example.com"
    },
    "line_items": [
      {
        "name": "Bluetooth Speaker",
        "quantity": 1,
        "price": "19.99"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

**Step 2: Define Transformation Rules**
1. Standardize customer names and emails across all platforms
2. Convert all price fields to consistent format (remove currency symbols)
3. Create a unified order format with common fields
4. Calculate derived fields (total order value, etc.)
5. Enrich with customer lifetime value from CRM

**Transformation Configuration:**
```json
{
  "transformations": [
    {
      "type": "field_mapping",
      "mappings": [
        {"source": "email", "destination": "customer_email", "platforms": ["shopify", "woocommerce"]},

        {"source": "customer.email", "destination": "customer_email", "platforms": ["shopify"]},
        {"source": "created_at", "destination": "order_date", "platforms": ["shopify"]},
        {"source": "date_created", "destination": "order_date", "platforms": ["woocommerce"]}
      ]
    },
    {
      "type": "field_operation",
      "field_name": "customer_email",

      "output_prefix": "item_"
    },
    {
      "type": "field_removal",
      "field_names": ["line_items"]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Step 3: Standardized Output Format**
```json
{
  "order_id": "shopify_123456789",
  "customer_email": "customer@example.com",
  "customer_name": "John Doe",
  "order_date": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "order_value": 29.99,
  "platform": "shopify",
  "item_name": "Wireless Headphones",
  "item_quantity": 1,
  "item_price": 29.99,
  "customer_ltv": 1450.75
}
```

## 8. Telecommunications Data Integration

### Scenario
A telecommunications provider needs to integrate customer, network, and billing data to improve service quality, reduce churn, and enhance customer experience.

### Current Challenge
- Siloed data across customer management, network operations, and billing systems
- High customer churn rates due to service issues
- Difficulty in identifying network problems affecting customer experience
- Inability to provide personalized service offerings

### Solution with Data Aggregator Platform:

**Step 1: Connect to Telecom Systems**
- Customer Relationship Management (CRM): Customer profiles and interactions
- Network Operations Center (NOC): Network performance and outage data
- Billing System: Usage patterns and payment history
- Support System: Customer complaints and service tickets
- Equipment Management: Network equipment status and performance

**Step 2: Customer Experience Scoring**
- Analyze network performance impact on individual customers
- Identify service quality issues for specific geographic areas
- Predict customer churn based on service and usage patterns
