## Recommendations

### ‚úÖ Maintain This Structure
1. Keep root folder clean (8-10 essential files max)
2. Archive completed milestone documents
3. Update VERIFICATION_COMPLETE_OCT_24.md as the "latest status"
4. Archive older verification documents as new ones are created

### ‚úÖ Future Archiving Policy
Archive documents when:
- Task completion reports are finalized
- Weekly reports are superseded by monthly summaries
- Progress reports become historical
- Status documents are superseded by newer versions
- Review reports are completed and issues addressed

### ‚úÖ Keep in Root
Essential files that should always remain in root:
- README.md
- CHANGELOG.md
- CONTRIBUTING.md
- LICENSE (when added)
- Active roadmap/task documents
- Latest status/verification document
- Deployment guides
- Quick start guides
