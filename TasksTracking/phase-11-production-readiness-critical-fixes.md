# Phase 11: Production Readiness & Critical Fixes (Weeks 93-104)

Execute mandatory security, testing, documentation, and infrastructure work identified in the November 18, 2025 comprehensive review.

**Status:** 🔴 Not Started | **Duration:** 12 weeks | **Blocking:** Production launch

## Critical Findings Overview

- ✅ Architecture, RBAC, and feature set graded B+ (85/100)
- ❌ Security middleware present but inactive in `backend/main.py`
- ❌ Error handling leaks internal details; correlation IDs absent
- ❌ Test coverage: backend 23%, API 37%, frontend 12%
- ❌ Documentation overstates technology usage (Spark/Flink/InfluxDB)
- 🚫 Missing 2FA, account lockout, CSRF protection

## Sub-Phase 11A: Critical Security Fixes (Week 93)

- [x] **SEC-001**: Wire security headers, rate limiting, and input validation middleware; add regression tests
- [x] **SEC-002**: Introduce centralized error handler with correlation IDs and scrubbed responses across 15+ files
- [x] **SEC-003**: Enforce strong `SECRET_KEY` configuration and rotation guidance

## Sub-Phase 11B: Test Coverage Expansion (Weeks 94-99)

### Week 94 – Security Test Suites

- [x] **TEST-001**: Email service (30 tests)
- [x] **TEST-002**: File upload and validation services (40 tests)
- [x] **TEST-003**: WebSocket authentication (20 tests)
- [x] **TEST-004**: Search service SQL injection protections (20 tests)
- [x] **TEST-005**: Monitoring endpoints (40 tests)

### Weeks 95-96 – Core Business Logic

- [x] **TEST-006**: Analytics engine coverage (60 tests)
- [x] **TEST-007**: Pipeline executor scenarios (50 tests)
- [x] **TEST-008**: Schema introspection and mapping (90 tests)

### Weeks 97-98 – Frontend Components

- [x] **TEST-009**: Pipeline builder UI suite (60 tests)
- [x] **TEST-010**: User management components (40 tests)
- [x] **TEST-011**: Chart components (40 tests)
- [x] **TEST-012**: Admin maintenance components (40 tests)

### Week 99 – Integration & E2E

- [ ] **TEST-013**: API integration workflows (50 tests)
- [ ] **TEST-014**: E2E user journeys (50 tests)

## Sub-Phase 11C: Production Features (Weeks 100-102)

- [ ] **FEAT-001**: Two-factor authentication (backend + frontend + docs)
- [ ] **FEAT-002**: Account lockout with admin override and notifications
- [ ] **FEAT-003**: CSRF protection middleware and validation

## Sub-Phase 11D: Documentation Corrections (Week 103)

- [ ] **DOC-101**: Purge inaccurate tech claims in `docs/architecture.md`
- [ ] **DOC-102**: Update `docs/prd.md` with actual platform capabilities
- [ ] **DOC-103**: Refresh `docs/database-schema.md` with current tables and constraints
- [ ] **DOC-104**: Author consolidated `CHANGELOG.md`
- [ ] **DOC-105**: Synchronize completion metrics and verification timestamps

## Sub-Phase 11E: Kubernetes & Performance (Week 104)

- [ ] **INFRA-001**: Author Helm charts and manifests; document deployment and rollback
- [ ] **PERF-001**: Establish load/performance testing suite with baseline report

## Launch Planning Guidance

- **MVP Launch (Week 97):** Requires completing Sub-Phases 11A-11B plus documentation corrections
- **Recommended Launch (Week 100):** Adds integration tests and core production features for 92% readiness
- **Full Launch (Week 105):** Completes all tasks including Kubernetes and performance benchmarking
